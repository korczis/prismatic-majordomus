# Where the Rust executable of this repository is.
#
# One question, asked by two callers with different answers to the *next* question:
# `bin/majordomus-mcp` may build it when it is missing, because an MCP client spawning a
# server can afford a build; `bin/majordomus-env` may never build it, because it runs on
# every `cd` and a shell prompt cannot afford one. Both need the same path, so the path is
# decided here and the build policy is decided by each caller.
#
# Order: an explicit MAJORDOMUS_BIN, then the executable an installed release ships beside
# bin/, then the crate's target directory, which is what a contributor has.
#
#   MAJORDOMUS_BIN            use this executable
#   MAJORDOMUS_BUILD_PROFILE  debug (default) or release
#   CARGO_TARGET_DIR          where cargo builds; read, never assumed
#
# Sourced by scripts that are not the shell tool, so it defines functions and sets nothing.

# mj_cargo_target_dir <crate-directory> [ask-cargo]
#
# Where cargo writes that crate's build outputs. Composing "<crate>/target" is a guess, and
# it is wrong the moment CARGO_TARGET_DIR is set — which is how several worktrees of this
# repository share one multi-gigabyte build directory instead of each carrying its own, and
# the only way a worktree survives another session deleting apps/majordomus-cli/target under
# it. Cargo then builds into the shared directory and a caller that composed the literal
# path runs an executable that was never there: scripts/derive died exactly that way, exit
# 127 on a path that does not exist.
#
# The environment is read first because it costs nothing and it is what such a session
# actually sets. `cargo metadata --format-version 1 --no-deps` is the authoritative answer —
# it folds in a build.target-dir from any .cargo/config.toml as well — but it is a whole
# process, ~80ms here, so it is asked only when the caller passes `ask-cargo`. The callers
# that do not are the ones that cannot: bin/majordomus-env runs on every `cd`, and
# test/lib.sh's rust_bin runs once per test case. Neither can spend 80ms to be told what an
# unset variable already said.
#
# One `target_directory` exists in that JSON, so the greedy match finds it without jq, which
# this file may not assume: it is sourced on the shell-prompt path.

# mj_rust_stale <repository-root> <executable>
#
# Is that executable missing, or older than any source, manifest or lock file of the crate?
# True (0) for either. One question with two answers again: `bin/majordomus-cli` builds when
# this is true, `bin/majordomus-env` only says so — but neither may decide it for itself,
# because a checkout where the two disagree is a checkout where entering the repository
# reports one thing and running a command does another.
#
# An explicit MAJORDOMUS_BIN is never judged stale *here*: whoever named a particular
# executable owns whether it is current, and it need not sit beside sources at all. Neither
# is a tree without the crate — an installed release has no sources to be older than.
#
# That trust is about mtime, and it stops there. It does not extend to whether the named
# executable is of this tree's *generation*, because it cannot: a binary built minutes ago
# from an older revision of the crate is newer than every source and still carries another
# model. On 2026-09-10 exactly that binary, handed over through MAJORDOMUS_BIN, rewrote a
# pristine origin/master and removed 16,625 lines without a diagnostic. The executable
# decides that question itself — `majordomus generate` compares the generation compiled
# into it against the crate of the repository it is asked to derive and refuses with exit
# 15 — so every caller of this file inherits the guard and no shell script has to carry a
# second, drifting copy of it.
#
# Why this matters beyond a rebuild: every surface of this repository — the banner, the
# workflow bridge, the completion, the shared MCP server — is a projection of this one
# file. When it is old, all of them are old together, and nothing in their output says so.
# Silence here reads as a feature that vanished.
