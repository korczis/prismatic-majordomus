# Applications

An application answers "in what context would someone use this": one Markdown file with
front matter (`share/schemas/application.schema.json`): when it fits, when it does not,
which use cases it composes, which rules and responsibilities it leans on; and a body
(`# Context`). A use case names the applications it belongs to and the application names
it back; `majordomus usecase validate` refuses a reference that resolves one way only.

`does_not_fit_when` is required: a catalogue that only lists fits is marketing.
