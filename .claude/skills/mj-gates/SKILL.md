# Majordomus `gates`

The capabilities the Majordomus registry declares in its module `gates`. Choose the one that answers the request below — or, without one, the person's last request about `gates` — call it through its MCP tool, and report what it answers, as it answered:

$ARGUMENTS

| Capability | What it is | MCP tool | Command line | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gates.completion` | Whether this task may be called finished | `majordomus_completion` | — | reads |
| `gates.headroom` | Whether each structure job fits in half its bound | `majordomus_gate_headroom` | `majordomus gates headroom` | reads |
| `gates.model` | The CI model | `majordomus_gates` | — | reads |
| `gates.policy` | The completion policy | `majordomus_completion_policy` | — | reads |
| `gates.state` | How each gate last went | `majordomus_gate_state` | — | reads |

A capability that *changes* something runs only when the person asked for that change: call it once, and if it is refused or its outcome is not known, report that as it is and do not try again by another way. One that *reads* may be called whenever the request needs it.

Without the Majordomus MCP server attached, run the command line form from the repository root; `--help` shows its arguments. What each capability accepts and answers is defined once, in its declaration: `majordomus capabilities describe <id>`, or the MCP tool's own description. This file is derived from the registry and says nothing the declarations do not.
