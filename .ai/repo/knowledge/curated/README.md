# Curated notes

Notes this repository wrote about itself, each one a Markdown file discovered through the
`curated` source class in `../sources.yaml`. `start-here.md` is the entry a worker with no
context reads first.

A note here earns its place by being something no other file in the repository already
says. It is not a summary of the documentation, not a copy of a rule, and not a place to
restate an ADR: those are sources of their own, discovered where they live, and a copy
here would be the second source of truth that goes stale first. Anything compiled from
the sources — an index, a graph — is a rebuildable product and belongs under
`../../../local/cache/`.
