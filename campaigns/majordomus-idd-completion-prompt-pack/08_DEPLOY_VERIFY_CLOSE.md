# Shared mission and operating contract

You are working inside the live `prismatic-majordomus` repository. Your task is to converge the existing Majordomus architecture around **Intent Driven Development (IDD)** as a first-class, canonical, executable and evidence-verified development model.

Core invariant:

> **Human intent is canonical. Work is derived. Reality is observed. Completion is proven.**

Target loop:

```text
Human Intent
    ↓
Canonical Intent
    ↓
Current-vs-desired gap + governance constraints
    ↓
Derived/linked milestones, issues, dependency graph, execution waves
    ↓
Provider-neutral sessions + mesh peers + handovers
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Discovery of actual repository/runtime state
    ↓
Validation + evidence
    ↓
Intent satisfaction evaluation
    ├─ unsatisfied → derive/replan remaining work
    └─ satisfied   → verified closure + proof lineage
```

## Live repository wins

A repository snapshot from 2026-09-11 was used only to build this prompt pack. It showed important existing primitives, but **it is not authoritative over the live checkout**. Before changing code, read the current `AGENTS.md`, `.ai/README.md`, effective rules, doctrines, policies, skills, workflows, ADRs and current implementation. Reconcile this prompt against the live repository. Never regress a newer design because this pack mentions an older path/name.

The snapshot already contained, among other things:

- milestones described as **executable specifications of outcomes**;
- issues described as **bounded execution contracts**;
- derived issue/milestone status rather than authored `status`;
- evidence-gated `DONE`/`VERIFY` semantics;
- validated dependency graphs and execution waves;
- roadmap derivation from milestone graph state;
- sessions and session-context records;
- handovers and blocker continuity across handovers;
- provider/session separation and provider lifecycle hooks;
- peer discovery/announcement/context integration;
- doctrine dispatch/enforcement and finish obligations;
- canonical capability/projection architecture;
- CLI/API/OpenAPI/MCP/site projections;
- strict derivation/cross-surface/canonical-architecture tests.

Treat these as **integration targets to reuse**, not invitations to create parallel machinery.

## Entry protocol

Before substantive work:

1. Update the local view of canonical trunk according to repository policy.
2. Read current `AGENTS.md` and `.ai/README.md` and follow their discovery protocol.
3. Run the current Majordomus context/preflight commands required by repository policy.
4. Inspect current task/milestone/issue/intent state before inventing a new record.
5. Inspect active peers and existing branches/worktrees. Announce intent and expected scope using the repository's current peer mechanism.
6. Use the canonical worktree topology. Do not do feature work in an invalid checkout merely because it is convenient.
7. Push work early enough that other peers can discover it.
8. Use repository-native generators and registries. Do not hand-edit generated projections.

If exact commands have changed since the snapshot, discover the current commands and use those.

## Non-negotiable architecture rules

- One canonical semantic definition, many derived projections.
- No hand-maintained duplicate inventories across CLI/API/MCP/Cockpit/docs/tests.
- Do not make the Cockpit a second source of truth.
- Do not make GitHub a second source of truth.
- Do not make a provider conversation the owner of project intent.
- Explicit human intent and machine-inferred/derived/observed facts must remain distinguishable through provenance.
- If a fact is machine-observable from an authoritative source, derive/observe it instead of asking humans or agents to duplicate it.
- Completion must be derived from current evidence and obligations, not trusted prose and not a manual boolean.
- Evidence must go stale when the underlying observed fact becomes stale or false.
- Cross-provider continuity must be proven at actual adapter/session boundaries, not by storing a provider name in a generic string.
- No mocks on product paths that claim to prove real backend integration.
- No surface-specific business logic that belongs in the canonical domain layer.
- No weakening/removing tests merely to make a new architecture pass.
- New canonical entities should propagate automatically to relevant projections without per-surface registration.

## Scope discipline

Do not explode this mission into unrelated improvements. Adjacent changes are required only when they are necessary to make the IDD invariant real, non-bypassable, testable and maintainable.

Prefer deleting or migrating redundant machinery over layering yet another adapter on top of it.

## Definition of real

For this work, a capability does not count as complete unless, as applicable, it is:

- represented in canonical typed/domain state;
- schema-valid;
- derived/inferred from authoritative sources where possible;
- integrated with existing milestone/issue/session/handover/mesh/evidence/governance architecture;
- exposed consistently through relevant CLI/API/OpenAPI/MCP/Cockpit/docs surfaces;
- covered by unit/integration/contract/E2E/regression tests;
- enforced through the existing doctrine/rule/gate system;
- generated projections are synchronized;
- committed/pushed/integrated according to repository workflow;
- deployed where the project claims a public/runtime surface;
- verified from the deployed/public surface, not merely asserted locally.

If deployment is blocked by a real external dependency, record the exact blocker and evidence. Never mark it successful by narrative.

## Existing tests/areas worth discovering

The 2026-09-11 snapshot included tests with names such as:

`05_handover`, `19_end_to_end`, `25_continuity_lifecycle`, `42_dag_waves`, `46_cross_surface`, `50_blocker_across_handover`, `55_session_context`, `60_session_lifecycle`, `71_context_sync`, `76_capabilities_projections`, `77_rust_evidence`, `90_mcp_shared_server`, `91_canonical_architecture`, `92_openapi_reference`, `98_traceability`, `99_plan_capabilities`, `103_obligations`, `104_strict_derivation`, `104_published_site`, `106_context_peers`, `111_session_per_provider`, `129_executable_issues`.

Search for their current equivalents. Extend the existing behavioral coverage rather than creating disconnected test islands.

## Required working style

Inspect → model → migrate → implement → test → integrate → document → enforce → deploy → verify → close.

Do not stop after an architecture report if implementation is possible. Do not ask for filenames, module names, obvious naming choices or routine confirmation. Infer them from the live repository and execute.

When ambiguity exists, preserve the repository's current architecture and choose the smallest design that makes the invariant explicit and testable.


# Prompt 08 — Integrate, deploy, verify and close

## Mission

Turn the implemented IDD changes into canonical repository reality. Anything left only in a branch/worktree/local server is unfinished.

## Pre-integration audit

Inspect all in-scope branches, worktrees, PRs, peer announcements and unpushed commits. Identify overlapping IDD work and resolve it deliberately. Do not let parallel sessions leave two competing Intent implementations.

Ensure:

- canonical trunk is fresh according to repository policy;
- generated artifacts are regenerated from canonical sources;
- versioning/release/changelog follows current automated policy;
- no stale references or dead duplicate registries remain;
- no local-machine paths/secrets leaked;
- docs/site links point to current routes;
- all new capabilities have use-case/test coverage where required.

## Full validation

Run the repository's canonical equivalents of:

- formatter/linter/compiler;
- unit/integration tests;
- schema checks;
- doctrine/rule/doctor gates;
- plan validation;
- use-case coverage/impact;
- cross-surface contracts;
- API/OpenAPI/MCP tests;
- Cockpit/browser/E2E tests if present;
- generated artifact drift checks;
- performance/budget checks;
- deployment/site tests.

Record exact commands/results as evidence linked to the active Intent/work.

## Integration

Merge/rebase/integrate using current repository doctrine. Ensure the final canonical branch contains the work and the remote contains the canonical commits. Remove obsolete branches/worktrees only according to project policy.

## Deploy

Deploy every surface for which the repository claims deployment as part of completion, including current docs/GitHub Pages and Cockpit/runtime paths where applicable.

Do not substitute a local preview for public verification.

## Verify

Probe the deployed/public result and verify at least:

- IDD docs/landing route reachable;
- canonical example rendered from real data;
- relevant API/OpenAPI/MCP/Cockpit route available if publicly/runtime exposed;
- deployed version/commit corresponds to integrated canonical state;
- links to tests/evidence are real;
- no mocks or stale sample state mislabeled as live.

Capture these observations as evidence.

## Closure

Re-evaluate the implementation Intent itself through the new IDD satisfaction loop. It must become satisfied because the evidence is present, not because this prompt says the work is done.

If it remains unsatisfied, continue working on the missing conditions. Do not close the issue/milestone/Intent merely to make the roadmap green.

## Final output

Produce an evidence-backed closure report with:

- integrated commit(s)/canonical branch;
- migrations/removals;
- all required test/gate results;
- deploy result;
- public/runtime verification;
- current derived Intent satisfaction;
- remaining blockers/debt only if genuinely unresolved.
