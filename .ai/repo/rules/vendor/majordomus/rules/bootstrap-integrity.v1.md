# Rationale

The path from a human reader to the AI layer is unbroken — README.md names AGENTS.md, every generated instruction file points at .ai/README.md, and none of them carries a rule of its own.

# Required behaviour

A person reaches the AI layer through README.md and AGENTS.md, every generated instruction file points at .ai/README.md, and none of them carries a rule of its own.

# Failure behaviour

A violation is a `FAIL` finding under the category `bootstrap`, and the command that found it exits 10. Under `watch` the same violation is reported as drift and the command exits 11.

# Verification

`mj_validate_bootstrap` decides it, dispatched from `doctor, watch`. The behavioural case `test/cases/03_update.sh` proves it, and CI runs that case.
