# Command line of the Rust executable

Majordomus control plane: a data-driven MCP server over the repository's .ai/ layer

The Rust executable of Majordomus. It reads the repository's provider-neutral AI layer under .ai/ and serves it, read-only, to MCP clients over stdio.

The task lifecycle (init, start, check, finish, doctor, ...) is the shell tool bin/majordomus in the same repository; this executable does not implement those commands.

Every command below is declared once, in `src/cli.rs`; this file is a projection of that declaration, as `--help` is. The task lifecycle (`init`, `start`, `check`, `finish`, `doctor`, ...) is the shell tool `bin/majordomus`, documented in `docs/CLI.md`.
