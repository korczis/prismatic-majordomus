# Profiles

A profile is one working mode: how much context a task of that kind is assembled with,
how much effort it is worth, how the worker reports, and what it must produce before it
may finish. One YAML file per mode, its `name` equal to the file name; the policy names
the default (`profiles.default`), and a task carries the profile it was started with.

The keys are closed by `share/allow/profile.txt` — a key nothing reads is an error, not a
silent no-op. `context.*` switches the sections the context builder assembles;
`requires.*` is what `majordomus finish` refuses to skip. Nothing here decides *what* a
worker does; it decides how much the tool spends on helping.

## Adding one

```bash
$EDITOR .ai/repo/profiles/my-mode.yaml     # name must equal the file name
majordomus doctor                          # parses every profile, resolves the default
majordomus start "..." --profile my-mode
```
