# Repository rules

A rule is a Markdown document with YAML front matter. The front matter is the machine
side: identity, class, dependencies, and how the tool enforces it. The body is the human
side: rationale, required behaviour, failure behaviour, verification.

## Locations

```text
project/                  rules this repository wrote
vendor/majordomus/        the pinned Majordomus baseline; do not edit, upgrade explicitly
```

The vendored package carries `manifest.yaml` naming every rule file with its identity and
content hash. A hand edit under `vendor/` is detected against that manifest and refused.

## Front matter

```yaml
---
id: project.example-rule        # identity; namespaced by origin
version: 1                       # an exact integer
kind: rule

  tests: []                      # the behavioural cases that prove it
---
```

Identity comes from `id` and `version`, never from the file name. A rule without an
`x-majordomus` block is normative for whoever reads it and enforced by nobody; the class
still says what a violation means.

## Loading

Resolve `depends_on` as a graph, deterministically: a missing dependency, a cycle, or two
rules claiming one identity at the same scope is an error, and a set that does not resolve
is not applied at all.

## Composition

The effective set is additive: every active vendored rule plus every active project rule.
A project rule may add a constraint. There is no override mechanism: nothing here disables
or weakens a vendored rule, and a project rule may not reuse a vendored identity.
