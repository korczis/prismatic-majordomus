# Majordomus `obligations`

The capabilities the Majordomus registry declares in its module `obligations`. Choose the one that answers the request below — or, without one, the person's last request about `obligations` — call it through its MCP tool, and report what it answers, as it answered:

$ARGUMENTS

| Capability | What it is | MCP tool | Command line | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `obligations.closure` | What this task still owes | `majordomus_obligation_closure` | — | reads |
| `obligations.vocabulary` | Every obligation there is | `majordomus_obligations` | — | reads |

A capability that *changes* something runs only when the person asked for that change: call it once, and if it is refused or its outcome is not known, report that as it is and do not try again by another way. One that *reads* may be called whenever the request needs it.

Without the Majordomus MCP server attached, run the command line form from the repository root; `--help` shows its arguments. What each capability accepts and answers is defined once, in its declaration: `majordomus capabilities describe <id>`, or the MCP tool's own description. This file is derived from the registry and says nothing the declarations do not.
