title: A record's changed_files names the work, not the tool's exhaust
description: The changed_files block of a checkpoint, a handover or a closed session names what the episode produced. Paths a declaration already calls generated, projected or local are classified out, and the classification reads those declarations rather than a list of its own.
statement: A record's changed_files is the working tree classified against the declarations that say what is derived — the scope file's generated and never-read sets, the policy's projection targets, the merge driver's derived trees, and the record stores themselves — never git status verbatim.

# Rationale

Running Majordomus dirties the tree. `majordomus update` rewrites CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md,
`majordomus generate` rewrites `share/allow/` and `share/schemas/`, `scripts/derive` rewrites
`docs/generated/` and `site/data/generated/`, and every command appends a line to the ledger.
Every record this tool writes took its `changed_files` straight from `git status
--porcelain`, so each one claimed all of that as the episode's work.

Measured, on this repository. The record at
`.ai/repo/sessions/20260910T103933Z--s-20260909152316-024f--master--38f056b--…` carries 122
changed files. Among them are the whole of `site/data/generated/`, eleven pages under
`site/content/sessions/`, twelve files under `docs/generated/` — and the three sibling
records of that very episode, plus `site/content/sessions/s-20260909152316-024f.md`, which
is that episode's own site projection. The record names itself as its own work product.

This is not cosmetic. A record is the account a later reader has of what a stretch of work
contained, and the site publishes it. A list in which the signal is three real files and the
noise is a hundred and nineteen is a list nobody reads, which makes the record an archive
rather than a memory — exactly what `majordomus.session-records` exists to prevent.

# Required behaviour

`lib/changed.sh` classifies the working tree and every record writer uses it. It carries no
list of derived paths of its own. Five things already say what is derived, each maintained
because something else needs it, and the classifier reads all five:

- `.ai/repo/scope.yaml`, `out.generated.paths` and `out.generated.names` — the tool's own
  declaration, shipped in the skeleton, so this works in any repository Majordomus
  supervises and not only in its own;
- `.ai/repo/scope.yaml`, `out.paths` — the never-read set, which is where `.ai/local/` is
  declared. A work product nobody may read is not a work product;
- `.ai/repo/policy.yaml`, `projections[].target` — CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, `.bb/AGENTS.md`;
- `.gitattributes`, every path marked `merge=derived` — the repository's own list of what
  its generator writes, maintained because the merge driver needs it (in this repository,
  covered by `test/cases/57_derived_merge_driver.sh`);
- the record stores themselves, by the resolvers that name them. These are not derived — a
  closed session record is a tracked object the executable indexes — but the tool writes
  them and the worker does not.

A repository that declares none of them loses nothing: the classifier then excludes nothing
and the list is what it was before. Adding a path to any of those declarations is what
changes the outcome, which is the point — a sixth list inside the classifier would be the
sixth place to forget.

# Failure behaviour

Advisory, and deliberately so. Every record written before `lib/changed.sh` carries the
unclassified list, and a record is immutable by contract: rewriting thirteen committed
session records so that a check goes green would be fabricating history, which is the thing
the work this rule arrived with exists to refuse. `doctor` reports how many records carry
derived paths, which one carries the most, and which is the newest — that last number is
what tells a reader whether the classifier is working, because a record written after it
landed and still naming derived paths is a regression rather than a legacy.

The blocking half is the behavioural case. `test/cases/136_changed_files_classifier.sh`
fails the build if a checkpoint, a handover or a closed session written today names a path
one of the declarations covers.

# Verification

`mj_validate_record_changed_files` in `lib/changed.sh`, dispatched from `doctor`, judges the
records that exist. `test/cases/136_changed_files_classifier.sh` judges the writers: it sets
each declaration in turn, writes one record of each kind, and asserts both halves — that the
work is named and that the exhaust is not. Its last section removes a declaration and proves
the path comes back, which is what shows the exclusion came from the declaration and not
from a constant in the classifier.
