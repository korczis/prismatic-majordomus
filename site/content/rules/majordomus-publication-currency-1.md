## Rationale

`majordomus.completion-gates` made the validation pipeline's verdict a property of the task
rather than of a pull request. It derives which gates apply from the change set's own paths,
which is the right derivation for every gate that measures a tree — and it is structurally
incapable of reaching the ones that do not.

A repository that publishes has two trees. There is the one in the checkout, which every
gate in the model examines, and there is the one the public is actually being served, which
none of them can see. The second is not a function of the first: it is a function of whether
a deployment ran, whether it ran to completion, whether the hosting provider's own build of
what was pushed succeeded, and whether anything has landed since. **No edit to any file can
make that question come out differently**, so a path class can never select the gate that
asks it, and a gate in no class is asked only by a full plan — which, on this repository,
runs on a push to master, *before* the publication it would judge.

The result is a question nobody owns. Three measured instances, each of which left every
commit-level check green:

- an unmerged ref served as the public site for about half an hour, noticed by a person's eye;
- twenty pull requests landed in one afternoon and the site sat hours behind the trunk;
- the hosting provider's own build of a correctly pushed commit errored, and the previous
  commit was served for 27 minutes.

The moment this question is worth asking is not when a file changes. It is when a worker
says the work is done, because "done" and "the public cannot see it" is the contradiction the
finish contract exists to refuse.

**Why this is measured and not recorded.** `majordomus.completion-gates` discharges a gate
with a ledger line carrying the hash of the files the gate was run over, and the run stops
counting when that hash changes. That mechanism cannot hold this verdict, because its subject
is not in the tree: a publication check run ten minutes ago describes a site that may have
been superseded since, with every file in the repository untouched. Evidence whose subject
can change without the tree changing has no hash to expire against, so it is not stored. The
gate is run, live, at the moment of the claim.

## Required behaviour

**The CI model declares which gates measure a deployment.** A gate with `at-finish: true`
is one of them. Nothing is hardcoded here: a repository that publishes nothing marks no
gate, and the requirement then has nothing to run and says so.

**The policy selects the requirement.** `publication_current` in `verification.finish_requires`
is what turns it on, like every other line of the contract.

**`finish` asks it, and `check` does not.** `check` is run often and cheaply, and this
gate reaches the network and waits for a CDN; making it part of every `check` would be a
slow, flaky `check`, which is a `check` people stop running. The session-end hook writes a
handover rather than a finish, so a session that hands over is never asked either — for the
same reason an honest `blocked` is not: `handed_over` is a claim about unfinished work, and
this requirement is about a claim that the work is done.

**Only the outcome `completed` is refused.** A task reporting itself `partial`, `blocked`,
`failed` or `no_match` is being honest about unfinished work, and refusing that teaches a
worker to claim `completed` instead — the argument `majordomus.completion-gates` already
makes, applied here unchanged.

**A verdict that could not be reached is reported, never inferred.** The gate distinguishes
"the publication is not current" from "I could not find out" — no network, no published
branch, no hosting API. The first refuses. The second is reported by name, with its reason,
and refuses nothing: a session on a train is not evidence that the site is stale, and a
requirement that cannot be satisfied offline would be waived within a week. Silence is not
green and it is not red either; it is named — the argument this repository states as
`project.never-reported-is-not-green`, which the package cannot depend on because a
vendored rule must resolve inside the package it ships in.

## Failure behaviour

A violation is a `FAIL` finding under the category `gate`, naming the gate, the command that
was run and the reason the gate gave — which commit is published, which commit is on the
trunk, how long the publication has been owed. `finish` exits 10 and writes nothing, so the
task stays active and the record never says completed. The remediation is the deployment,
not a flag.

## Verification

`mj_validate_publication_currency` decides it, dispatched from `finish`, reading the gates
the CI model marks `at-finish` and running each one. `test/cases/275_publication_is_current.sh`
proves it against fixture repositories whose gate scripts are written by the case: one that
exits 0, one that exits 10, one that exits 12, one that declares no such gate, and one
finishing with an outcome other than `completed`.
