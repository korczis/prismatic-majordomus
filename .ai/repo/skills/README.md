# Skills

Reusable, provider-neutral operational procedures: how to do one bounded kind of work in
this repository well, written so that any capable worker can follow it. A skill is loaded
when the task is about what the skill covers, never by default. Keep each one short and
executable; a skill that merely describes is documentation and belongs in `docs/`.

## The contract

A skill is one directory `<id>/` in this section holding `SKILL.md`, and nothing else
registers it: the source class `skill` in `../knowledge/sources.yaml` discovers every
`*/SKILL.md` here, and that one declaration is what `majordomus skills`, `doctor`, the
website and the MCP server all read. Adding the directory and tracking it in git is the
whole act of adding a skill; removing it removes the skill from every surface.

`SKILL.md` is YAML front matter over a Markdown body. The front matter satisfies
`share/schemas/skill.schema.json` of the tool distribution — an unknown key is an error:

```yaml
---
schema: skill/v1          # the contract this file follows
id: repo-review           # lower-case letters, digits, hyphens; must equal the directory name
version: 1                # an integer; raise it when the procedure changes materially
title: Repository review
description: One sentence; shown by every listing.
status: active            # draft | active | deprecated
tags: [review, evidence]  # optional
related: [implement]      # optional; every id must name a skill in this section
inputs:                   # optional; what the worker must have before starting
  - a checkout with git history available
outputs:                  # optional; what the procedure leaves behind
  - findings with severity, evidence and the smallest fix
---
```

The body is the procedure and carries three level-one sections, each non-empty:
`# Purpose` (what the skill establishes and what it is not for), `# Procedure` (the
ordered steps, with what to read and what to look for), and `# Output` (the contract of
what the worker produces). Any other section is allowed; `# When to use` is conventional.
The body names commands and files, never a provider or a provider's tool.

`examples/*.md` beside `SKILL.md` are optional: each opens with a level-one heading (its
title) and shows an invocation intent in provider-neutral terms. They are tracked as
documents, rendered on the skill's page, and checked for their heading.

## Adding one

```bash
mkdir -p .ai/repo/skills/my-skill/examples
$EDITOR .ai/repo/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md      # the front matter and the three sections above
git add .ai/repo/skills/my-skill
majordomus skills check                        # every reason, or the counts of what passed
majordomus skills show my-skill
scripts/generate-site-data                     # the site's skills.json and page (this repository)
```

`majordomus skills list` shows every skill in discovery order; `skills check` (and
`doctor`, through the doctrine `majordomus.skill-integrity`) refuses an unknown key, a
wrong schema version, a non-integer version, a status outside the closed set, an id that
is not the directory name, a missing or empty required section, two skills with one id,
a `related` id that names nothing, and an example without a heading. A repository with no
skills is reported as such, never passed silently.

## What is derived, and must not be edited

`share/allow/skill.txt` (from the schema, by `majordomus generate allow`), the MCP
resources `majordomus://skill/<id>` and the entries `majordomus_list` returns for the
kind, `site/data/generated/skills.json` and `site/content/skills/` (by
`scripts/generate-site-data`), and the pages under `/skills/` on the website. Each is
regenerated from the files here, and the drift checks CI runs (`generate --check`,
`generate-site-data --check`) fail while one is behind. No list of skills exists anywhere
by hand; the inventory is this directory.
