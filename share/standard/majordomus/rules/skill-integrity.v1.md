title: Skill integrity
description: Every skill the repository declares parses against the skill contract, names the directory it lives in, carries its sections, and every skill or example it refers to exists.
statement: A skill is canonical data under the skills section; it is valid against the skill schema, its id is its directory, its body carries the sections a reader relies on, and every reference it makes resolves.

# Rationale

A skill is loaded only when a task is about what it covers, so a broken one is not noticed until the moment a worker needs it. Validating every skill on every `doctor` run means the failure surfaces in the tree, with the file named, not in a session that loaded half a procedure. The catalogue every surface reads is derived from the same discovery the executable indexes, so a skill that exists for one interface exists for all of them.

# Required behaviour

Every file the source class `skill` discovers has front matter that satisfies `share/schemas/skill.schema.json` (no unknown key, `schema: skill/v1`, an integer `version`, a `status` from the closed set), an `id` equal to its directory name, and a body with non-empty `# Purpose`, `# Procedure` and `# Output` sections. No two skills claim one id. Every `related` id names a skill in the catalogue, and every tracked example under a skill's `examples/` opens with a level-one heading.

# Failure behaviour

A violation is a `FAIL` finding under the category `skill`, naming the file and every reason, and the command that found it exits 10. Under `watch` the same violation is reported as drift and the command exits 11. A repository with no skills is reported as such, never as a pass over nothing.

# Verification

`mj_validate_skills` decides it, dispatched from `doctor, watch`; `majordomus skills check` runs the same examination on demand and prints its counts. The behavioural case `test/cases/95_skills.sh` proves it, and CI runs that case.
